# Slim 3 Quick Start

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 3 application.

This boilerplate application was built for Composer. This makes setting up a new Slim Framework application quick and easy.

## Install the Application

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Slim Framework application.

```composer create-project jonatanflores/slim3-jwt-quick-start name-of-your-project```

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `public/` directory.

Also run this command.

```composer update```


That's it! Now go build something cool.
